<h2>A Tale from
The Arabian Nights
Retold by Laurence Housman</h2>

<p>The Sultan Shahriar stands out to fame as the
greatest monogamist in all history. Having
been deceived by his first wife, he caused her to
be put to death, and then proceeded to avenge
himself upon a thousand others. Faithful to his
monogamic instincts, he married a fresh wife every
day, and on the morning of the next became a
widower. Having thus achieved faith to a thousand
dead maidens&mdash;all equally beloved in turn&mdash;he
may, in his heart of hearts, have found that
change, so doggedly insisted on, did but mean
boredom, and so may readily have welcomed any
excuse to relax a performance to which he had
bound himself by many religious oaths.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>But, if he had a heart, the old Eastern chronicler
has neglected to tell us what was in it; and
at the point where his sacrificial bridals have become
monotonous, the interest of the story shifts
from bridegroom to bride, and Scheherazade,
daughter of the Grand Vizier, witty, courageous,
resourceful, and most prolix of all delightful tale-tellers,
adventurously enters the royal menage, and
becomes his only surviving wife.</p>

<p>For Scheherazade, intent on saving the lives of
others, brings her bridesmaid with her, a younger
sister named Dinarzade; and when the morning
light comes to tell her that death is near, Dinarzade&mdash;prompted
thereto beforehand&mdash;stirs in her
attendant place at the foot of the couch, and asks
for the sake of old times that one last tale may
be told.</p>

<p>Shahriar, at the bride's humble request, grants
permission, and from that moment is in the toils
of the plot which has made his name so secondary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>in importance to hers. Scheherazade, 'to do a
great right, does a little wrong': by her entrancing
powers of narrative, always interrupted when
the interest of each story is at its height, she breeds
in her tyrant lord infirmity of will, and destroys
the only principle of conduct wherewith he set
out to teach woman her place. For the thousand
and one nights which have given their
name to the world's most famous collection of
stories, he lives blissfully forsworn, postponing
the execution of his wife to another day; and
at the end, repenting him of his vows, does what
we still make our kings do in England when
justice has gone astray, and bestows his 'free
pardon' upon innocence.</p>

<p>The story which is here retold, with many
of its life-saving prolixities omitted, has the
distinction of being, according to some versions,
the last of all: it witnesses the accomplishment
of the task which Scheherazade set out to perform.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>With the story of Badoura, the woman of
beauty and brain, who, personating her husband,
ruled a Kingdom, and without jealousy provided
him at the end of his wanderings with a second
wife&mdash;in this story Scheherazade, her great act
of statesmanship concluded, adumbrates what
woman set free to use her own resources can do.
And in this reflection of her own great adventurous
self the series concludes. Through a
thousand dim dawns, with the issue still in
doubt, she has led the forlorn hope for all the
other women whose lives she would save; and
when her tyrant relents, and in his promise to
spare her life spares theirs as well, she kneels
and gratefully kisses his feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>The
History of Badoura,
Princess of China, and of
Camaralzaman, The Island Prince</p>

<p>The story of Aboulhassan, the Prince of
Persia, had come to an end and the light
of morning was full. Then said Dinarzade,
'Another story, O sister, another story!' Scheherazade
made answer, 'If my Lord will suffer
me to live for another day, there is yet one more
tale that I could tell. The history of Prince
Camaralzaman and of his bride Badoura is far
more entrancing than that which I have just
given; but it is too long to be told now.'</p>

<p>Then she was silent; and Shahriar could not
bring himself to order her death till he had heard
that story also. So once more he let his oath stay
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>unfulfilled and deferred sentence; and the next
night, wakened in the small hours towards dawn,
Scheherazade, opening a mouth of loveliness and
filling it with wise and sweet words, took up the
thread of her tale and began:</p>

<p>O King, live for ever! About twenty days'
sail from the coast of Persia there lies in the open
sea an island which is called Khaledan, a country
wealthy and prosperous and containing many
large and well-inhabited towns. Its ruler in
ancient times was a king named Shahzaman.
As a reward for his many virtues, he had gathered
about him a large and well-proportioned household,
four wives, the daughters of kings, and sixty
concubines; but, in spite of so generous a provision
for that which only Heaven can bestow,
he had no son; and as time went on, and he
grew old, his bones wasted, and his heart became
filled with affliction; and he said to his Vizier,
'Now in a little while I shall die; then will my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>name perish, and my Kingdom pass to others, for
I have not a son to come after me. Tell me,
is there anything I can do to avert so great a
calamity?'</p>

<p>His Vizier answered, 'When human means
fail, it is then that we must rely on Heaven, for
often these evils are sent to remind us of our
dependence on Him who alone holds power.
Fast, therefore, and pray, and perform ablutions,
and when that is done make a great banquet, and
call to it the poor and needy; it may be that
among them will be found one pure and righteous
soul whose blessing will thus descend on thee, for
the fulfilment of thy desire.'</p>

<p>The King did as his Vizier advised: he made
a great feast, and called to it all whose poverty
might give virtue to their petition: and bidding
them pray that he might have a son, caused meat to
be set before them; so they did eat and were filled.</p>

<p>This holy act had the desired effect; one of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>the King's four Queens immediately conceived,
and in course of time presented him with a son as
fair as a full moon on a cloudless night. When
the midwives and nurses carried him to his father,
the King, seeing his beauty and transported with
joy at the event, named him Camaralzaman, that is
to say Moon of the Age; and he sent out orders,
on pain of death to any who disobeyed, that for
seven days the drums were to beat and every house
in the city to be decorated in sign of thanksgiving.
Never were such rejoicings heard.</p>

<p>The Prince was reared and educated with all
care and magnificence until he attained the age of
fifteen. For the polish of his manners and the
enlightenment of his brain the wisest and most
accomplished men in the Kingdom were chosen;
and since from the first he displayed a modest
and docile disposition, combined with a fine understanding,
he became, as he approached the years
of manhood, the most virtuous and eligible heir to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>a throne that monarch or people could find it in
their hearts to desire.</p>

<p>He was of surpassing comeliness and grace,
perfect in form and stature; and his father loved
him so tenderly that he could scarcely bear to be
away from him either by night or day. This
devotion to his son was, indeed, so excessive, that
the King himself was perturbed by it, for always
accompanying it was a terror lest the Prince might
die.</p>

<p>One day he said to his Grand Vizier, 'How
came it that my happiness in the possession of such
a son gives me anxiety rather than rest? When I
was childless I was miserable, and now that the
desire of my heart has been satisfied, I am full of
dread lest he also should die childless and my hope
of posterity fail? Calamities and accidents come
when we least expect them, and so it seems to me
now that the Prince being vigorous and strong is
in greater danger of death than I who am near the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>grave. For him a thousand perils are waiting,
while I have nothing to fear but old age. If,
therefore, I may not see my son married in my
own lifetime I shall die in a state more miserable
than that which I endured before he was born.'</p>

<p>His Vizier said, 'The Prince is still full young,
but nothing forbids that he should marry if, by the
will of Allah, we can find one worthy of him.'</p>

<p>'As for that,' said the King, 'Heaven cannot
have willed to send into the world a form of beauty
and of virtue so pre-eminent without also providing
a fitting match for it. Doubt not, if the Prince
himself is willing, that some maiden not too far
beneath him will be found capable of sustaining
the honour.'</p>

<p>So Shahzaman sent for his son, and Camaralzaman
came and stood before him, and when he
saw the King seated in state upon his throne,
though not having his lords round him, the Prince
bade reverence take the place of love, and with his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>head bowed down toward the ground waited in
submission for the royal word to be spoken.</p>

<p>Thus he stood before his father humbly as a
stranger; for never before had the King so received
him, and he wondered why he had been summoned,
and in his heart there was a fear.</p>

<p>The King perceiving his reserve said to him,
'My son, can you now guess for what reason I
have sent for you?' But the Prince answered,
'My lord, I would not so presume; for it is not
in the power of one so young as I am to fathom
the thoughts of the hearts of Kings. Only when I
hear the true reason from your Majesty's lips will
my brain become enlightened.'</p>

<p>So he spoke, with all the decorum, and deference,
and virtue, and prudent modesty which
had been instilled in him by the preceptors of his
youth; and Shahzaman, his father, loved him for
it, and said in his heart, 'Never was King blessed
with such a son as I.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>Then he said to the Prince, 'What thou
lackest in years of man's estate thou hast already
gained in wisdom and understanding; therefore
as a man I speak to thee. Know, then, it is my
wish that thou shouldst marry, so that before my
days are ended I may rejoice in the assurance of
my posterity.'</p>

<p>When Camaralzaman heard these words he
no longer hung his head, but stood up straight;
and as he made answer to the King his face flushed
and his eyes grew bright; and said he, 'O my
father, is it into bondage you would deliver me
ere I become a man? Lo, here am I, the son of
Kings, and all my life till now have I been free,
and my soul has been free within me, because I
have not gone in the way of women nor inclined
my heart toward them; but if I marry, then by
their cunning and guile will my soul and my
freedom be taken from me. Far rather would I
drink the cup of death.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>When King Shahzaman heard that, the light of
day darkened before him, for never until now had
his son gone against his wish or disobeyed his
word. But, because he loved the youth very
tenderly, he forgave him and thought not at this
time to punish him; for he said to himself, 'At
present he is full young, and excess of virtue hath
caused his manhood to slumber.' So he forbore,
and waited till another year should have passed,
and withdrew not from his son the light and
favour of his countenance.</p>

<p>So Camaralzaman continued in undisturbed life
to receive the instructions of his preceptors, and
every day he increased in beauty and comeliness
of form, in modesty of mind, and in grace of
manner and in elegance of deportment. Added
to which, he became accomplished in verse, and
eloquence, and rhetoric and the divine sciences,
so that the flower of his form and the honey of
his understanding made together a thing of inconceivable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>loveliness and attraction. Even as a
magical willow-branch bearing peach-blossom and
fruit at one season, so was he.</p>

<p>Now when another year was completed, his
father having once more consulted with the Grand
Vizier, sent for him again, and said, 'This time,
O my son, listen to my word, and obey; for now
have thy years touched manhood, and unless thou
beget children thy virtue and wisdom are wasted.
Therefore if thou wilt marry her whom I shall
now choose for thee, I will also make thee ruler
over all my dominions; so with mine eyes shall
I see my kingdom and my posterity established,
and rejoice in thee before I die.'</p>

<p>But the Prince had listened so well to the preceptors
set over him to guard his virtue, and had
pondered so deeply the books which wise men
had written in their old age, when delight had fled
from them and when all that they had done in
the past seemed only to be vanity, that his mind,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>even though his heart softened to his father's request,
remained as aforetime. Therefore, abasing
himself in fear and reverence at the King's
feet, he said, 'O my father, not so can I find
happiness, or strength, or wisdom wherewith to
rule others, seeing that if I marry I cease to be
ruler of myself. In all things outward it is
Allah's will that I should obey you; but in this
which comes from within and concerns myself
alone, I can obey the voice of no man, however
wise he may be. Yet, by all the seers and poets
and soothsayers is the same thing told, that woman
is a calamity, and that from her spring all the
weaknesses and afflictions of men.' And so saying
with sweetness and modulation of tone, and grace
of gesture, Camaralzaman began to recite to his
father all the words of the poets; and there was
not a poet who had written poetry in his old age
whose verses did not bear out the contention.</p>

<p>So when the King had heard the verses of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>poets and the words of the ancients arrayed against
him, he returned no answer; for he said to himself:
'I doubt not but that before another year
shall have run that voice within will have spoken
differently to my son than it speaks now, and the
words of the sages will have far less weight with
him then than the glance of some woman's eye.'
Once more, therefore, letting his tenderness extinguish
his resentment, he forgave the Prince's
disobedience and received him back into his
favour.</p>

<p>But to his Grand Vizier Shahzaman said,
'Now twice, O Vizier, have I come to thee for
advice, and what profit has it been? When I
consulted thee first as to marrying my son thy
word was for it; yet no sooner did I mention it
to him than his mind rebelled. This time also, it
was on thy advice that I sought to bribe him by
the offer of power; but when I offered him the
Crown, so little did he care that he seemed almost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>not to have heard me. What better advice, then,
wilt thou give me now so that my patience may be
rewarded and my heart obtain its desire?'</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 266px;"><a id="pl02"></a>

<p class="caption">Dahnash and Meymooneh.<br />

<div class="figcenter">
<a href="images/large/pl02.jpg"><img src="images/pl02.jpg" alt="Dahnash and Meymooneh" /></a></div>

<hr class="r35" />

<p>The Vizier answered, 'O King, thy son hath
presumed on thy forbearance, knowing well thy
tenderness, and when thou hast spoken with him
it hath been privately and as a father. But when
a year hence the time comes to speak with him
again on this matter, then speak not to him
privately any more, but before all the people,
with the emirs and the viziers and the troops
standing by. Then he will no longer dare to
oppose thee, since to do so before all those
witnesses would be an offence treasonable and
worthy of death.'</p>

<p>So the King accepted the advice of his Vizier,
and when another year had gone by he summoned
the Prince to his presence on a day of
festival, when all about him were the dignitaries
and chamberlains of his court, the viziers of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>provinces, and the emirs of neighbouring states
who paid tribute to Shahzaman as their Sultan.
Thus he sat in all his power and splendour, and
Camaralzaman came in and drew near, and stood
before him, being then in his eighteenth year, with
the early bloom of manhood beginning to show
upon his cheek. Allah, who loves to give beauty
to virtue, had clothed him in comeliness and
crowned his features with joy; his eyes were like
pools of deep water and their glances flashed like
a fountain in the sun; and from head to foot
whether he moved or stood he was perfect in
dignity and grace.</p>

<p>As he approached, thrice he bent and kissed
the ground in sign of obedience and reverence,
and thereafter stood upright, with hands folded
behind his back, waiting to hear the King's
pleasure.</p>

<p>Shahzaman spoke. 'Once more, O my son,
I have sent for thee to declare my will. Twice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>ere this have I been tender and patient, not
forcing an inclination that was not ripe. But
now thou art come to man's estate, and the season
of waiting is ended. Therefore my command is
that thou marry a daughter of kings, whom
presently I shall choose for thee; so shall I have
joy in thee before I die, seeing the establishment
of my posterity.'</p>

<p>When Camaralzaman heard these words he
shut fast his lips and stood speechless for a while.
But as his eye fell on all those lords assembled as
witnesses as to what he should say, wrath kindled
in his blood and the fire of youth mounted to his
brain and he spoke swiftly and unadvisedly.</p>

<p>'Surely,' he said, 'thou art a man of great age
and little sense thus to talk, having already been
answered! Twice before hast thou asked me,
and twice have I refused. Thinkest thou with all
these cooks to make a better broth of me, having
thyself failed? I swear now that rather than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>marry I will drink the cup of perdition and die:
for no man shall possess himself of my body to
give it to another while my will is contrary!'
And so saying Camaralzaman unclasped his hands
from behind his back, and rolling up his sleeves
stood before his father all quivering with anger.</p>

<p>Greatly was Shahzaman, the King, disturbed
at receiving so public an affront from the son
whom he loved so tenderly. For a moment he
sat speechless, seeing in the eyes of those around
him the reflection of his humiliation and shame;
then his energy returned to him, and rising from his
throne he uttered so terrible a cry of wrath that
at once Camaralzaman became conscious of the
enormity of his offence, and his hasty anger
departed leaving only contrition and fear.</p>

<p>Then, at the King's command, the memlooks
came and seized him, and having first bound his
hands, dragged him before the throne.</p>

<p>The extremity of Shahzaman's wrath now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>broke into words, and while the Prince stood
speechless before him, his head bowed down and
with drops of anguish upon his brow, he loaded
him with a volume of abuse which did not spare
even the Queen's unblemished reputation. 'Woe to
thee,' he cried, 'baseborn child of iniquity and
deceit! Is it thus that a King is to be answered
in the presence of his people? Is it thus that a
son nurtured in the tenderest affection casts insult
on the head of his father. Had such language
been uttered by one of the common people, it had
been less disgraceful and more pardonable than
coming from thee.'</p>

<p>Then he commanded the memlooks to take
him away and imprison him in the deepest
dungeon of the castle, which had long stood
neglected and empty.</p>

<p>Servants of the Prince hearing of that order
went in haste and prepared the chamber for his
reception; they swept the walls of its cobwebs,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>and wiped the damp from the floors; they placed
in it a bedstead, and on it laid a mattress and a
leather covering and cushions; they also provided
a large lantern and a candle, for even in the
daytime the place was dark. To this dungeon
came Camaralzaman escorted by his guard, and
when all had been made secure and a eunuch set
outside to keep watch, there they left him.</p>

<p>Camaralzaman threw himself upon the couch
weeping, for bitterly now did he repent of his
injurious conduct to his father; yet even in his
affliction he ceased not to inveigh against marriage.
'Malediction upon women!' he cried,
'alas, why were they invented to give sting to the
affections and divide father and son! Had Allah
refrained from creating women, certainly I should
not have been here!'</p>

<p>Thus in his misfortune did Camaralzaman find
truths to comfort him. Meanwhile the King, his
father, was suffering an equal affliction, and lacking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>the philosophy of youth he sought to find comfort
in laying the blame for all that had happened upon
the Grand Vizier. 'See, O Vizier!' he cried,
'what comes of taking counsel with thee! Thou
alone hast been the cause of my son's undoing;
for had I spoken to him privately on this matter
as aforetime, he would not have answered me otherwise
than as a son should and in such manner
as would have made forgiveness possible. Now,
therefore, since we are brought to this pass by the
foolishness of thy wisdom, it is for thee to devise
means by which we may find a remedy.'</p>

<p>The Vizier replied: 'O King, let the Prince
stay where he is for another fifteen days, so shall
he have time to cool himself. I doubt not that
thereafter his mind toward marriage will be all that
your heart can desire. Better to him then will
seem the bride's chamber than the stone walls of
his prison.'</p>

<p>Shahzaman took the Vizier's advice and slept
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>on it, or rather slept not at all, for the loss of his
son so troubled him that he lay awake all night
tossing restlessly from side to side and longing for
the light of day.</p>

<p>Far better did Camaralzaman fare; for when
night came the eunuch brought lantern and candle,
and having prepared a table set food before him.
The Prince ate little and thought much, sorrow
for his ill-conduct having severed his appetite in
half, and when he had finished he called for
water and washed his hands from all taint of
food; then he performed the ablution preparatory
to prayer, and recited with his accustomed
regularity the prayers of sunset and nightfall.
After that he sat upon the couch reciting
extracts from the Koran: he recited the chapters
from 'The Cow' and 'The Family of Emran'
and 'The Two Preventives'; and having done
all these things he commended his soul to Allah
and laid himself down upon the couch, whereon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>was a mattress of figured satin showing its pattern
on both sides and stuffed abundantly with ostrich
plumes. And when sleep drew near he took off
his outer raiment and clothed himself in a fine
shirt of waxed linen, and wrapped about his head
a kerchief of blue muslin so that he seemed like
the moon on its fourteenth night. Then with
the lantern at his feet and the candle at his head,
he covered himself with the sheet and fell into the
sleep of the just from which he awakened not till
after the third hour, knowing nought of the hidden
event which then awaited him, or what Allah, who
knoweth all secrets, had decreed should befell.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a href="images/large/pl03.jpg"><img src="images/pl03.jpg" alt="The King of China and Badoura" /></a></div>

<hr class="r35" />

<p>Now in the floor of this dungeon was an old
well malodorous and foul through long disuse;
and in this well dwelt a female Genie or Efreet,
named Meymooneh, a monster of bad ancestry and
of tremendous power to set evil above good. Toward
midnight, when the hour for her nightly
wanderings had come, Meymooneh rose up like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>a bubble from the bottom of the well and lifting
her head over the brim saw a light which had not
been there formerly and under it a couch whereon
lay some one asleep.</p>

<p>Full of wonder, she drew up her feet to earth,
and advancing, cautiously turned back the coverlet
from the sleeper's face. Thereafter she stood
for a whole hour lost in wonder and astonishment
at the beauty which she found there: perfect
in all its lines and colour and texture was the
loveliness of the sleeping youth, and there arose
from his body an odour like fragrant musk.
Meymooneh snuffed at it, and her heart became
enlarged, lifting her thoughts toward Heaven.
'Blessed be Allah!' she cried, 'surely He must
be good to have created this thing.' And as she
continued to gaze, her mind acquired a benevolence
which had long since been strange to it.
'By Allah,' she said, 'in no way will I injure
him; rather will I watch over and protect him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>from any that may seek to do him harm.' And
so saying she stooped over the youth and kissed
him between the eyes.</p>

<p>Then elated of heart she spread her wings
and smiting the earth with her heel sprang
upward and floated away into space, till the
heavens about her were clear. As she rose up
through clouds she heard above her head a
flapping of wings, and there passed one she
knew by his tail to be Dahnash, an Efreet greatly
inferior in power to herself. After him she went
like a hawk, pounced and caught him by the scruff.</p>

<p>Dahnash, perceiving into whose clutches he
had fallen, quivered through all his members, and
imploring pardon for his existence cried, 'I
conjure thee by the Most High Name and the
sign on the Seal of Solomon that this time and
for the present thou shouldst release me. So
will I go upon my errand and return presently.'</p>

<p>Then said Meymooneh, 'By the high oath
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>which thou hast sworn, what errand art thou
after?'</p>

<p>Dahnash answered, 'I have seen once with
mine eyes that which should make the wicked
virtuous, and the foul-minded clean; therefore
I am in haste to make known the story of it to
others less virtuous than thou art; so that they
too may see it and find reward.'</p>

<p>'Though I am more virtuous than thou art,'
replied Meymooneh, 'yet shalt thou tell me thy
story, else I will pluck off every scale from thy
body and every feather from thy wings and throw
thee to the bottomless pit. And if what thou
tellest be not true then also shalt thou fare as I
have said.'</p>

<p>Then said Dahnash,' O Meymooneh, if my
word be not true, invent for me what tortures
thou wilt and I will accept them. I am come
to-night from the farthest isles of China, which
are the dominions of King Gaiour, who is lord
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>also of the Seas and of the Seven Palaces. There
have I seen the Princess, his daughter, for whom
also these palaces were built; surely there is none
like her in all the world! Her hair is as dark
as the night of separation and exile, and her face
is like the dawn when lovers meet to embrace;
her nose hath both point and edge, and her
cheeks are like petals of anemone filled with
wine. When she speaks, wisdom flows from her
tongue; and when she moves, her feet faint with
delight under the burden of the loveliness laid
on them. The King's love for her is so great
that there is no limit to what he will bestow on
her if only it may add to her happiness; therefore
in her honour hath he built the seven palaces:
the first is of crystal, the second of marble, the
third of steel, the fourth of onyx, the fifth silver,
the sixth is of inlaid gold, and the seventh of all
manner of jewels. Also these palaces are most
sumptuously furnished, and around them lie gardens
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>embellished with everything that can soothe the
senses and delight the eye. Yet all this is but as
a shade when the beauty of the Princess shines in
the midst of it. Because the fame of her incomparable
loveliness has gone far and wide, many
kings and powerful princes come to demand her
hand in marriage. But so tender is the King's
love for her, that in all these years without her
free consent he has married her to none. Many
a time has he sought to persuade her, but it is all
in vain. 'For where,' says the Princess, 'shall I
have honour and freedom such as I enjoy now?
Here I sit at thy side in council and am a ruler
over men; but if I marry then will my husband
rule me.' And now there has come to the court
of King Gaiour, another monarch, so dreaded and
so powerful that his suit cannot be refused.
Nevertheless the Princess, whose name is Badoura,
will not consent; and having threatened to kill
herself rather than submit, the King now treats
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>her as insane in order to excuse himself, and hath
shut her up in one of her palaces with ten old
women to look after her. There she has been
confined for a whole year, but the imprisonment
has done nothing either to change her will or
diminish the enchantment of her beauty. So
to-night when I saw her lying asleep every evil
thought and passion died within me, for so holy
is her beauty that I respected her even as I respect
myself. Come, Meymooneh, and you shall see
what is indeed a miracle and a wonder!'</p>

<p>So far had Dahnash proceeded, when Meymooneh
impatiently interrupted him. First, she
cuffed him over the head, and then spitting in
his face cried with laughter, 'O fool, what eyes
have you to behold beauty, or what tongue to
tell of it? This Princess that you speak of is,
I doubt not, a poor insignificant creature not
worth looking at. What would you say, then,
if I shewed you my own beloved? Little talk
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>would there be then of this fine Princess of
yours; you would have but to look at him
once and you would go crazy with jealousy.'</p>

<p>Dahnash replied humbly, 'O Mistress of
language and of facts, far be it from me to deny
beauty that you yourself have verified; but neither
can I deny that which I, in turn, have beheld and
think to be incomparable. All I can ask, therefore,
is that you should accompany me to the bedchamber
of this adorable Princess, where she now
lies sleeping, and judge for yourself.'</p>

<p>'Not so,' answered Meymooneh, 'wherefore
should I travel to the far ends of China merely to
prove thy folly and thy falsehood? Here close
at hand is the tower wherein my beloved lies
prisoner; come, then, and see for yourself the
face of him whose loveliness even in sleep puts all
other beauty to scorn.'</p>

<p>So they descended, and passing through the
roof and floors of the tower came to the dungeon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>below, where Camaralzaman lay sleeping. There
by the bedside Meymooneh put forth her hand
and drew back the sheet; and Dahnash gazed
with awe and remained silent, for doubt swayed
him. Nevertheless after a while he said, 'O
Meymooneh, though my word may seem hard to
believe, yet do I still say that she whom I saw is
fairer than this youth; and needs must it be so,
since the fairest woman is by her sex made fairer
than the fairest man. But for that, these two
whom we contend over might be twin flowers
from the same stem, so like are they.'</p>

<p>When Meymooneh heard that she struck him
a hard blow over the head with her wing, crying,
'Go, accursed one, fly back to China, lift up thy
beloved and bring her quickly to this place; so
when we see them side by side shall it be manifest
which one is the more beautiful. Then if I am
right thou shalt pay forfeit to me, and if thou art
right I will pay.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>Then with inconceivable swiftness Dahnash
departed; and within an hour returned bearing
the Princess in his arms. She was clad in a
gown of finest silk with two borders of gold,
and when the Efreet laid her upon the bed beside
Camaralzaman, the two proved to be so alike that
they might have been twin brother and sister.
Nevertheless Meymooneh and Dahnash continued
to say each to each, 'My beloved is more beautiful
than thine.' Nor was agreement possible between
them.</p>

<p>Therefore after much strife, wherein Dahnash,
though physically worsted, stuck to his opinion,
they determined to refer the matter to an arbitrator,
and by his sentence to abide.</p>

<p>Then Meymooneh struck the ground with
her foot and cried 'Kashkash!' Instantly the
earth opened and there arose from it an Efreet
hideous to look upon; he was blind of an eye,
and lame of a leg, and upon his back he carried a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>hump bigger than the rest of his body; and when
he saw Meymooneh he prostrated himself before
her, saying, 'O Mistress and daughter of Kings,
what dost thou require of me?'</p>

<p>Meymooneh told him of the contention that
had arisen between them, and showing him the
Prince and Princess lying side by side called on him
to say which was the more beautiful of the two.</p>

<p>But Kashkash, having considered them for a
while with great attention, replied, 'When mortals
are endowed with such beauty as these, then only
themselves can decide. Let us, then, awake them
each in turn, and the one that draws from the
other the most violent protestations of love and
admiration shall be esteemed the more beautiful.'</p>

<p>This proposal was approved both by Meymooneh
and Dahnash.</p>

<p>Thereupon Meymooneh transformed herself
into a flea, and leaping upon Camaralzaman's
neck bit him in a soft place. The youth put
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>up his hand and rubbed to allay the smarting;
then moving sideways he touched something
that stirred, and starting up saw by his side a
maiden of most marvellous beauty.</p>

<p>No sooner had he beheld her than all his
reasons against marriage were confounded and put
to flight; and he said within his heart, 'What
God desireth will come to pass, and what He
desireth not will not happen.' Then taking the
Princess by the hand, he endeavoured gently to
rouse her, and ceasing not to invoke her with
words and kisses of tenderness, he would infallibly
have awakened her had not Dahnash bound her
by a spell.</p>

<p>Then, seeing how fast she slept, 'What!'
cried the Prince, 'must the love of Camaralzaman
admit an impediment such as this? Awake, O
beloved!' Carried away by his words he was
tempted for a moment to assail her rudely, but
then the nobility of his nature reasserted itself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>and respect for her beauty and innocence constrained
him. Then he bethought himself, and
said, 'Doubtless this is the honourable maiden to
whom the King, my father, intended to marry
me. Oh why, instead of argument, did he not
show me her face? So would none of this
trouble have come about!'</p>

<p>Then perceiving upon the Princess's finger a
ring, he drew it off and exchanged it for his own,
saying, 'Since I may not yet possess myself of the
owner I will take this.' And having so done, he
turned his back to her and slept.</p>

<p>Then Meymooneh, jealous of the testimony
which Camaralzaman had given to the Princess's
beauty, transformed herself again into a flea, and
entering beneath the clothes of Badoura, the beloved
of Dahnash, bit her sharply; whereupon
she opened her eyes and sat up; and there at her
side beheld a youth snoring in his sleep, with eyelashes
shading roseate cheeks and a mouth like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>the seal of Solomon. No sooner had she seen
him than her heart was filled with contending
emotions. 'Oh me!' she cried, 'what disgrace
is this that has come upon me to be lying in
the same bed with a stranger? But, by Allah,
he is so beautiful that I have much ado not to
love him to distraction. Nay, if this be the
Prince who came demanding my hand in
marriage of my father, I would have been willing
to marry him ten times over had I but known
beforehand.'</p>

<p>So saying she seized Camaralzaman by the arm
and shook him so violently that, saving for the
enchantment, he must surely have awakened.</p>

<p>Thereat she lost patience. 'Self-satisfied
youth,' she cried, 'is this the way to behave to a
Princess upon the night of her bridal? What?
has so much beauty made thee proud?' Then as
love began to devour her heart, 'O my lord,' she
cried, 'light of mine eyes, and moon of my existence,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>arise, awake out of sleep!' And forthwith
seizing his hand she began kissing it. While she
was doing so she saw her ring upon his little finger,
and uttered a cry of astonishment; while even
greater became her amaze when she found upon
her own hand a strange ring. This, she thought,
must surely mean that she had become wedded to
him in her sleep, so putting away all false modesty
and fear she lay down again by his side, and fell
fast asleep.</p>

<p>Then Meymooneh and Dahnash, seeing how
evenly between the pair the balance of love and
admiration was divided, composed their difference;
and Dahnash, taking the sleeping Princess upon
his shoulder, carried her back to China.</p>

<p class="p2">When Camaralzaman awoke the next morning
to find no maiden at his side, he supposed that
the King, his father, had caused her to be carried
away secretly, in order that thereby his desire for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>her might be increased. So he called to the slave
who guarded him and said, 'Tell me of the lady
who slept with me last night: how came she, and
who brought her?'</p>

<p>The slave replied, 'O Prince, there was no
lady; how could any lady get in while I slept all
night across the doorway, and had the key?'</p>

<p>This answer so infuriated the Prince that he
fetched the slave a buffet which knocked him
over; then tying him to the well rope he let
him down into the well, though it was the middle
of winter; and this he continued to do, now up,
now down, saying as he did so, 'When thou hast
told me the truth I will let thee go.'</p>

<p>After a while the unfortunate slave, at the last
gasp for wretchedness, cried, 'O Prince, restore to
me my life and I will tell thee all.'</p>

<p>So Camaralzaman drew him up and laid him to
drain upon the floor.</p>

<p>Then the eunuch, with shiverings and chattering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>of teeth, said, 'Alas, Master, in my present
plight I have not tongue nor wits to tell thee the
whole story. Suffer me to go hence and get dry,
then will I return.' So Camaralzaman let him go.</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<p class="caption">Camaralzaman as an Astrologer.<br />
'At last the King heard him, and said to the Vizier, "Go down
and bring the Astrologer in."' (<a href="#Page_67">p. 67</a>)</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a href="images/large/pl04.jpg"><img src="images/pl04.jpg" alt="Camaralzaman as an Astrologer" /></a></div>

<hr class="r35" />

<p>Off ran the eunuch, and without stopping came
even as he was into the presence of Shahzaman, the
King. Shahzaman was complaining to the Grand
Vizier of the misery he had endured and the restless
night he had passed, when the slave entered all
a-drench with wetness and forthwith uttered his
tidings. 'O King,' he cried, 'insanity hath seized
on thy son, and thus hath he done to me! He
saith there hath been a lady in his bed, when
there hath been no lady; and because I cannot
tell him how she came or how she went, or where
now he can find her, see from what a drowning I
have escaped!'</p>

<p>When the King heard these words his sorrow
for his son and his wrath against the Vizier knew
no bounds. 'Go, accursed,' he cried, 'this is thy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>doing. Go to the Prince and discover the true
cause of his malady; then come again and tell me.'</p>

<p>So the Vizier hastened, treading upon his
skirts as he went forth in fear of the King's anger,
and coming to the tower found the Prince not mad
at all, but seated upon the couch reciting verses
from the Koran with the utmost composure.</p>

<p>'O Prince,' cried the Vizier, 'the mere sight
of thee relieves me of affliction; but so have I the
more reason to complain of that vile slave who
attends on thee, and hath said shameful things
concerning thee to thy father, the King.'</p>

<p>'I also,' answered the Prince, 'have great
reason to complain of him; but let that be for
a while, and tell me now what has become of the
lady who slept with me last night? For I know my
father must have sent her to me for a just purpose,
and to cure me of my folly: which indeed she hath
done. So let that sweet remedy return to me and
you shall find me sane.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>'Of a truth, Prince,' replied the Vizier, 'the
King, thy father, sent no lady to thee, and all
that thou sayest now is mystery. Bethink thee,
shut in here a prisoner, how canst thou have seen
any lady with thine eyes except in a dream?'</p>

<p>'O ill-omened old man,' cried the Prince,
'thou wilt be saying next that I saw her only
with my ears!' And approaching the Vizier he
seized him by the beard, which was long, and
twisting it this way and that, cried, 'Tell me
the truth, or I will treat thee as I did the slave!'</p>

<p>Then the Vizier, to save himself from further
ill-treatment, replied even as the slave had done,
and said, 'O Prince, I am not free to reveal the
secrets of my master, but I will take to him any
message wherewith you may be pleased to entrust
me.'</p>

<p>'Go, then,' answered the Prince, 'and tell my
father that I repent of my former words and
will marry the lady he sent to me last night,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>but no other, though he should put me to a
thousand deaths!'</p>

<p>So the Vizier, as soon as Camaralzaman had
let go of his beard, returned in haste to the King
and said to him, 'O my lord, what the slave says
is true; the Prince hath been seized with insanity
of the most violent kind; yea, he heareth with
his eyes, and seeth with his ears, and declareth
a lady hath slept with him, whom he will marry
and no other.'</p>

<p>Then Shahzaman went himself to see the
Prince and to learn the truth of this matter, for
he doubted the Vizier's word. And when he
came to the prison, his son received him with so
much respect, and contrition and devotion, that
he turned upon the Vizier with eyes of anger
and reproach, crying, 'O wretch, why hast thou
afflicted me with lies?' But the Vizier only
shook his head sorrowfully, waiting for the truth
to reveal itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>Then said the King, 'O my son, what day
of the week is it?' Camaralzaman answered,
'To-day is Saturday, to-morrow is Sunday,
the next day is Monday, then comes Tuesday,
then Wednesday, then Thursday and then
Friday.'</p>

<p>'Praise be to Allah!' cried the King, 'my
son is not mad, for he knows the days of the
week.' Then he said to Camaralzaman, 'Tell
me, my son, who is this lady who, you say, slept
with you last night; for truly I know nothing
about her.'</p>

<p>'O my lord,' replied the Prince, 'I pray that
you cease to mock me, for though I have deserved
it through my folly, yet now am I ready and
eager to marry this lady whom you have chosen
for me, since her beauty delights me, and her
manners, even in her sleep, fascinate me.'</p>

<p>On hearing these words the King was as
much astonished as the Vizier had been; but the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>countenance of his son was so full of ingenuousness
and truth that he was not as incredulous as
the others had been before him. 'I swear to
you, my son,' said he, 'that I know nothing of
this matter. What my Vizier has told you, he
invented to appease your anger. But now tell
me everything, just as it happened, for whether
it be true or no, this event has given me cause
for rejoicing.'</p>

<p>Then the Prince sat down by his father's
side and told him everything, and when he had
finished he showed him the ring for proof that
his tale was true; and the King was so convinced
by his son's manner and by all the incidents
of the story, that he had not a word to say
against it.</p>

<p>Therefore was his heart uplifted, and he said
to Camaralzaman, 'Though all these things be
mysteries in the hands of Allah, so deep that we
may not fathom them, yet now hast thou convinced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>me that thou art not as was said of thee.
Keep, therefore, that precious mind to which
Heaven hath given light, and possess thyself in
patience till the mystery hath resolved itself.'</p>

<p>But Camaralzaman replied, 'Alas, O my
father, to what term of imprisonment dost thou
now condemn me? for if thou canst not find for
me this maiden who hath ravished my heart, surely
I shall die of anguish. So great is my love and
my distraction that I cannot wait for her even
an hour.'</p>

<p>Upon this the King smote his palms together,
and cried, 'Now are we in the hands of Allah,
where no mortal power can avail!' Then he took
his son gently by the hand and led him back to
the palace: and there the Prince threw himself
down upon a bed of sickness, too weak to rise or
look up: and Shahzaman seated himself at his
side, mourning and weeping for his grief, and
leaving him neither by day or night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>But after a while his Vizier came to him and
said, 'O King of the Age, how long shall thy
people seek for thee, and not find thee? Thy
troops murmur that they have none to lead them
to the field, and in the city corruption grows rife
because the seat of judgment stays empty. This
sickness into which the Prince has fallen comes
only from grief; and as his grief increases thine,
so does thine give nourishment to his. Therefore
I entreat your Majesty to provide some
better relief for the complaint both of the
Prince and of the people. Here in the city
his spirits languish and his strength returns
not; but take him to the palace which is upon
the shore looking toward the islands; there shall
his soul, on the days when thou art absent,
find peace and refreshment. And do thou, O
King, on two days in each week return to the
affairs of state, which need thy presence, to give
audiences and to hold councils, else out of these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>two evils which are upon us there may grow a
greater.'</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<p>So Shahzaman did as his Vizier advised him,
and caused the Prince to be carried, all wasted as
he was with grief, to a pavilion which was upon
the shore, and there on the days when affairs of
state caused the King to be absent Camaralzaman
lay and looked out over the sea.</p>


<p>While these things were happening in the
land of Khaledan, Dahnash had conveyed the
Princess of China safely back to her own bed.
There the next morning she awoke, unstained by
travel and with her raiment undisturbed; nor was
she conscious that she had been anywhere but
where she now was. No sooner, therefore, did she
perceive on looking to left and right that the
youth who had lain in her bosom was no longer
near her than her heart became agitated and her
reason confounded, and she uttered a loud cry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>All her women came running; and her nurse,
who was the chief, inquired what misfortune had
befallen her. The Princess, who continued to
search among the bedclothes, said, 'Vexatious and
contrary old woman, what have you done with the
beautiful youth who slept last night in my bosom,
or how comes it that I have mislaid him?'</p>

<p>At these words the nurse was shocked in her
morals and confounded in her understanding, and
she answered, 'O mistress, what mean these
disgraceful words! Surely thy bosom is guiltless
of any such deed, and no youth, whether beautiful
or otherwise, has been near thee.'</p>

<p>Badoura answered, 'He had black eyes and a
lovely face, and a mouth like the seal of Solomon,
and his eyebrows were joined where I kissed
them; and he was here sleeping at my side from
nightfall to nigh upon daybreak.'</p>

<p>'Princess,' answered her nurse, 'thou hast
had an unpermissible dream and art talking non-sense.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>No such young man hath been near thee,
nor would I have permitted it.'</p>

<p>Then the Princess lifting her hand in anger
saw upon it the ring which Camaralzaman had
given her in exchange for her own, and cried to
her nurse, 'Woe to thee, O deceitful! Have I
also dreamed this ring which is not mine and lost
that which belonged to me?' And so saying she
started to belabour her nurse so unmercifully, that
she would assuredly have killed her had not all
the other women and the eunuchs lifted up their
voices in lamentation; whereupon the Princess,
who greatly disliked loud noises, desisted.</p>

<p>So the nurse, escaping from her vengeance,
fled and acquainted the King with all that had
happened and with the story which the Princess
had told her.</p>

<p>The King came in haste and found that
which till now he had only pretended concerning
his daughter apparently come true. For excess of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>reason had fled to her brain, and rushing this way
and that she was searching for her beloved in every
cupboard, and under every article of furniture,
crying, 'Where is the beautiful youth who slept
in my bosom last night? He belongs to me; he
is mine. If I do not find him I shall die.'</p>

<p>When her father saw and heard this he
inquired no further, but ordered the slaves and
eunuchs to seize her, and bind her with chains
lest she should do herself or others an injury.</p>

<p>So they put a chain about her neck and
fastened her to a window of the palace looking
toward the sea, that so by the will of Allah her
thoughts might have rest and her reason be restored.
And the King, loving her tenderly and
greatly distressed at the condition she had fallen
into, caused a proclamation to be issued to all
sages, astrologers, and men skilled in such matters
saying, 'Whosoever shall cure my daughter of her
present malady, to him will I give her hand in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>marriage together with the half of my kingdom;
and whoso fails to cure her, having offered, his
head will I strike off and set it above the gates of
my palace as a warning to others.' This he
continued to do till forty of the wisest physicians
and astrologers had lost their heads. Then
the supply foiled; and the Princess, whom
the offer of any husband other than the one she
sighed for threw into paroxysms of wrath, was as
far from a cure at the end as at the beginning.
Thus she remained for the space of three years,
sitting at a window with a chain about her neck
and looking out over the sea.</p>

<p class="p2">Now the nurse of the Princess Badoura had a
son named Marzavan, who was a great traveller.
He was foster-brother to the Princess; when they
were children she had been to him as his own
sister; and the two loved each other tenderly.
So on the day when he returned from his travels
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>he went to the palace to get tidings of the
Princess, and there over the gates were ranged the
heads of the forty wise men. This surprised him
greatly, and when on inquiring into the matter
he learned the cause, he heard also of the unhappy
state into which the Princess had fallen. The
news troubled him far more deeply than the death
of forty wise men who had been found foolish,
but, unwilling to trust to the judgment of others
in such a case, being himself also well skilled in
medicine, he besought his mother to obtain for
him an interview with the Princess.</p>

<p>This was a difficult matter, for the door of the
chamber was strictly guarded, and no one had
access to it except the nurse herself. So urgent,
however, was her son's entreaty, that at last she
consented and set about finding the means. To
this end she said to the eunuch who was on guard
at the door, 'You know well my devotion to the
Princess, and my desire to do anything that may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>alleviate her affliction, therefore I am come to ask
you for a favour. I have a daughter whom my
mistress from her earliest childhood, when I
nursed them together, has ever regarded with the
tenderest affection. She has lately married, and
the Princess, hearing of this event, has expressed
a wish to see her. Allow this to be; and do
not doubt that Heaven will reward you for your
goodness.'</p>

<p>The eunuch readily consented in spite of the
strictness of his orders. 'Let her come at night,'
he said, 'or bring her yourself, after the King has
retired: then the door shall be open and no one
need know of it.'</p>

<p>Accordingly, the next night, the nurse disguised
Marzavan in woman's attire, and taking his
hand in hers led him to the palace. The eunuch
let them pass without suspicion; but as soon as
they were in the Princess's presence, and the door
shut behind them, the nurse said, 'O mistress, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>have brought gladness to you to-night; for this is
no woman but my son Marzavan, who, having returned
from his travels, wished greatly to see you.'
No sooner did the Princess hear the name of
Marzavan than she sprang joyfully forward, the
full length of her chain, and being held back by it,
she stretched her hands toward him, crying, 'O
brother, come to me!' When Marzavan beheld
her in that unhappy plight, then for weeping he
could not look at her, but turned away his head
and covered his eyes. Then said Badoura, 'Dost
thou also think that I am mad like the rest of
them? Nay, hear my story and be undeceived,
for it is true.'</p>

<p>Then she told Marzavan everything; and he,
perceiving that she was in love, doubted no longer,
for he knew that such passion and such a desire
for beauty could arise neither out of madness nor
of a dream. So when she besought his aid, he
pondered deeply what he might do, and then said,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>'O sister, have patience yet a little while, and I
will go search through the world for thy missing
friend. Be assured that if he lives I will find him.'
Then they embraced as brother and sister in full
affection; and Marzavan departed.</p>

<p>The next day he set out once more upon his
travels, and continued to journey from city to city,
and island to island for the space of some months.
At first, wherever he went, he heard men speaking
of the beauty of the Princess Badoura and of the
strange malady that afflicted her; but presently, as
he changed from country to country, her name
ceased to be upon men's lips, and he heard instead
of one by name Camaralzaman, a prince of the
Islands of Khaledan, who for three years had
suffered from a grievous affliction of body and a
desolation of spirit to which there seemed no
remedy.</p>

<p>Marzavan did not delay when he heard that
story; but inquiring for the nearest route he took
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>ship and sailed from the city of Torf, where these
tidings had first reached him, to the islands of
Khaledan, a whole month's voyage; and all the
way he was glad so that his heart sang. But on
the day when the ship approached the dominions
of Shahzaman, there arose a great storm which
broke the mast and carried away the sail and
capsized the vessel.</p>

<p>Marzavan, thrown overboard with the rest, was
caught by a strong current and carried shorewards;
and as fate would have it, since the destiny of all
are in the hands of the Most High, the current
bore him toward that part of the coast where stood
the palace of the King; and there at that time, in
the pavilion looking toward the sea, sat Shahzaman
attended by his Vizier; and the head of Camaralzaman
lay upon his lap; and a eunuch was whisking
the flies from him.</p>

<p>The Vizier, looking out from the terrace, saw
in the water below him the shipwrecked Marzavan,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>tossed this way and that and unable to land;
so his heart was moved with pity and he came
running to the King and crying, 'Permit me, O
my lord, to open the gates of the court and put
forth my hand to save yonder man who is now
drowning. For since a just action is never without
reward, it may be he shall bring us good.'</p>

<p>Shahzaman replied, 'Thou art the cause of all
our trouble, and I doubt not that coming by thy
hand this drowning man will bring us more. Yet
I cannot forbid thee to save his life: only be sure
that he comes not near us to spy upon my son in
his affliction and report it to others. If he do, his
head and thine shall be forfeit.'</p>

<p>So the Vizier ran, and opening the gates of the
court leaned down, and caught Marzavan by the
hair and drew him up to dry land. And Marzavan
came forth from the sea all lost to consciousness,
his stomach filled with water and his eyes protruding.
The Vizier waited till his spirit had returned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>to him; then he took from him his clothes and
clad him in others and put on his head the turban
of an attendant and said to him, 'Now, as I have
saved thy life, do my bidding and save mine also.
Cast down thine eyes, speak not, look not into any
chamber as we go, but follow closely where I lead
lest worse befall thee.'</p>

<p>Then said Marzavan, 'What is this peril that I
am not to see?'</p>

<p>The Vizier answered, 'It is the King's son,
who is sorely afflicted for the loss of a fair damsel
that came to him but once and is gone again, none
knows where. That is the story, and on pain of
death all who hear it must believe it.' And the
Vizier sighed heavily, for at this time life was hard
to him and belief difficult.</p>

<p>When the half-drowned Marzavan heard that,
his heart went up like a singing bird, and he skipt
at the Vizier's heels like a squirrel. And when
they came by the chamber where Camaralzaman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>was lying, with the King seated beside him,
then Marzavan turned swiftly and went in
and stood before him; and no sooner had he
seen the Prince than, with an exclamation of joy,
he cried: 'Extolled be the perfection of him
who hath given beauty its pair! Lo, the eyes are
hers, the complexion is hers, the lips and the
cheeks are hers!'</p>

<p>At these words the knees of the Vizier went
from under him, and he prayed succour of death:
but on the heart of Camaralzaman there descended
a coolness and a refreshment, and turning his
tongue in his mouth, he signalled with his hand
to Shahzaman to make the young man sit down.</p>

<p>The King seeing the look of joy upon his son's
face easily forgave the intrusion which had earned
death; and having placed Marzavan in the seat at
the Prince's side, he bade him recount his history
and whence and why he came.</p>

<p>So Marzavan told of the country from which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>he had come and of its King and people, and of
all the events of his journey, but of the real cause
which had brought him he said nothing. And the
Prince listened and waited, for he saw that something
was concealed: and all the while, since hope
had returned to him, his countenance grew bright
and his strength of body increased. So presently
he made a sign for his father to raise him to a sitting
posture; and the King, full of joy, lifted him,
and placed cushions behind him and under him.
Thus after three years of lying down did Camaralzaman
sit up. So after a while Shahzaman, seeing
how by the conversation of Marzavan the Prince
was restored to health, went away and left them;
and the Vizier departed also.</p>

<p>Then, seeing that they were alone, Marzavan
spoke low in the ear of Camaralzaman saying, 'O
Prince, thy sorrow is at an end; for she whom
thou lovest is the Princess Badoura, daughter of
the King of China and my own foster-sister: and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>I am come through the world seeking thee because
of my devotion to her, who, for love of thee, now
lieth in chains. All that hath happened unto thee
with thy father hath happened to her also with
her father, yea, and worse things also.' So he
went on and told him all.</p>

<p>Now when Camaralzaman had heard the story
of the Princess, and of her sufferings and constancy,
and of all the useless cures for her malady
that had been tried, his heart was divided in its
joy by an overflowing of sorrow, even as a rich
country is divided and broken by a stream when
it floods its banks; and he said to Marzavan,
'Alas! how may I bring her the true cure, seeing
that we dwell in such different parts of the world,
and my father will not suffer me to be out of his
sight even for one day?'</p>

<p>Marzavan answered, 'For thy health's sake
he will allow thee that one, and it shall suffice.
For to-morrow thou shalt say to him, "Let me go
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>out into the hills for a day and a night, that I may
hunt and recover my strength," and surely he shall
not deny it to thee. And when thou hast found
that for which thou art in search, I know that thou
wilt return to him. But we will take with us two
spare horses and saddlebags, with money sufficient
for our journey, and when we have started upon
our way I will provide, so that we may not be
pursued and overtaken.'</p>

<p>At these words the Prince rejoiced greatly,
and it all came about even as Marzavan had
planned. For on the morrow the King, rejoicing
that his son's health was so quickly restored,
granted him the permission he sought, saying
only, 'Be not absent, my son, longer than one
night, for while thou art away from me I have no
joy left.' Camaralzaman answered, 'The night
of sorrow will end, then shall I return.' So he
took leave of his father and departed.</p>

<a href="images/large/pl06.jpg"><img src="images/pl06.jpg" alt="Camaralzaman Finds the Talisman" /></a></div>

<hr class="r35" />

<p>For the whole of that day until the evening
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>Camaralzaman and Marzavan went in the direction
they had chosen, setting their laces for the open
country and the seaport lying beyond. And
when it was night they ate and drank, fed their
beasts, and rested for a while; then they remounted
and journeyed on. At daybreak they
came to a spacious tract of forest; there Marzavan
took one of the led horses and killed it, stripping
the flesh from its bones; next he took the garments
which Camaralzaman had worn on the
previous day, and after tearing them this way and
that daubed them with blood.</p>

<p>Camaralzaman inquired why he did this: and
Marzavan answered, 'When we return not great
search will be made for thee, and I doubt not, if
it went far enough, we should be overtaken. But
when the searchers come upon this they will
suppose that a wild beast has fallen upon thee and
devoured thee; and that I, fearing the King's
wrath, have fled away. Doubtless the news will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>bring great sorrow to thy father's heart; but
when thou returnest with thine errand safely
accomplished, he shall be recompensed with
joy.'</p>

<p>The Prince sorrowfully commended the plan
which Marzavan had devised for the safety of their
enterprise; and so they continued upon their way
unmolested, and after much travelling by land and
water, and many adventures not to be told of here,
they arrived at the capital of the dominions of
King Gaiour, where the Princess Badoura lay in
captivity.</p>

<p>Marzavan did not take Camaralzaman to his
own house, but to a public khan, where for
three days they remained recovering from the
fatigues of their journey. Then, having clothed
the Prince in the garb of a merchant-doctor
with all the signs and instruments of his calling,
he conducted him to the gates of the palace;
standing before which Camaralzaman began, on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>the instructions of Marzavan, to cry in a loud
voice, 'Look at me, for I am learned! Marvel
at me, for I am wise! I am the healer, the
calculator, the astrologer; I know the cause
of all maladies and their cure. If any one, be
he king or peasant, is in affliction, let him come
to me!'</p>

<p>The people were greatly astonished to hear
once more an astrologer so bold of tongue; and
pitying him for his youth and wondering at the
beauty of his form, they pointed to the heads
which were over the palace gates, saying, 'While
there is time save thyself; for if the King hear
thee thy head will be joined to those.'</p>

<p>Nevertheless Camaralzaman continued to cry
with a loud voice; till at last the King heard him,
and said to his Vizier, 'Go down, and bring this
astrologer in.'</p>

<p>So the Vizier went out and fetched him, and
Camaralzaman came and bowed himself before the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>King. And when the King looked at him, his
heart also was moved with pity toward the
stranger, as the heart of the people had been,
because of his youth and the beauty of his form.
And he said to him, 'My son, comply not with my
conditions; for I have bound myself with an oath,
and whoso goes in to visit my daughter but cannot
cure her, his head must I strike off; and of a
truth you have but to look over my palace gate to
see that her malady is obstinate. Nevertheless if
you can cure her she is yours, and the half of my
kingdom is yours also.'</p>

<p>Camaralzaman said, 'To those conditions, O
King, I am agreed!' Then the King, sighing
heavily, sent for the eunuch and bade him conduct
the astrologer to the apartment of the
Princess.</p>

<p>The eunuch led the way; but when they were
come to the corridor wherein Badoura's chamber
was situated, so great was the joy of the Prince
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>that he hastened and went before; and the eunuch
called after him, 'Tarry, good sir, and be not so
hasty before the event, for I alone have the key
that shall bring thee to thy death! Never was
any other astrologer in such haste to depart from
life as thou.'</p>

<p>'Friend,' answered Camaralzaman, 'they had
not such science as I have to make them glad:
for they could not tell what the end would be, but
I know it already, nay, even without entering that
door of which thou hast the key I can cure the
Princess of her malady.'</p>

<p>The eunuch, astonished to be met with so
much confidence, ceased from his taunts, and admitted
the Prince to the ante-chamber. 'If thou
canst do that,' he said, 'thou art indeed the wonder
of the world. Truly were I only permitted to
see such a marvel accomplished, I should account
myself rich.'</p>

<p>Thereupon Camaralzaman seated himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>against the curtain which divided the outer from
the inner chamber and wrote the following prescription:</p>

<p>'He whom estrangement hath afflicted is cured
when the vow of the beloved is accomplished; and
the heart of exile findeth restoration in union with
that which was lost. Love alone can heal those
whom love hath persecuted.'</p>

<p>Underneath this prescription he added the
following words:</p>

<p>'From the distracted, the passionate, the perplexed,
the famished with longing, the captive of
transport and ardent desire, Camaralzaman, son of
Shahzaman, King of Khaledan, to the peerless one
of her age, the pre-eminent among Hooris, the
Princess Badoura, daughter of Gaiour, King of
the Isles of China and lord of the seven Palaces.
Behold the slave of the ring who, sleepless and
inflamed by love, now awaits the call of his Beloved.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>Then, having enclosed the ring which at their
first meeting he had exchanged for his own, he
sealed the missive, and putting it into the hands
of the eunuch bade him carry it to his mistress.</p>

<p>No sooner had the Princess Badoura received
the missive and the ring than she knew at once
from whom it came. Whereupon joy overthrew
her reason, and leaping up in a transport of exultation
she pressed her feet against the wall, and breaking
the chains which bound her ran forth and
threw herself into the arms of Camaralzaman.</p>

<p>Speechless with joy she kissed him without
ceasing; even as a pigeon when it feeds its young,
so upon the lips of Camaralzaman fell the kisses of
the Princess Badoura. Then came the nurse, crying
aloud for gladness to behold the joy of her
mistress and the healing of her malady accomplished;
and presently after her came the King.
For to him had run the eunuch in swift haste
bringing tidings of the event&mdash;how that without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>entering her chamber the astrologer had cured
her. 'What?' cried the King, 'can such news
be true?' 'O my lord,' answered the eunuch,
'let thine own eyes look upon her and be blest;
for she hath broken her chains of iron, and coming
forth to the astrologer she falleth upon him and
kisseth him, and never will she let him go.'</p>

<p>So Gaiour the King came and found it even
as the eunuch had said. Full of joy to behold so
sweet a sight, he embraced first the Princess and
then the Prince, thanking him with tears of gratitude
for the debt which he owed him. And when
he inquired further and learned of Camaralzaman
his name, and his true rank, and of the country
from which he came, with all the strange story of
his love and the grief of his separation, then his
satisfaction and delight knew no bounds. And so
on that very day the nuptials were celebrated, and
word of rejoicing went forth through the whole of
the King's dominions.</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>The hearts of Prince Camaralzaman and his
bride were now so full of happiness that for many
months they wist not the passing of time, and
waking or sleeping it seemed to them as one day.
But while their joy thus decked itself in the colours
of immortality, the Prince one night had a dream,
wherein he beheld his father, Shahzaman, lying
as at the point of death. And in his dream it
seemed that he heard him say, 'O my son, whom
in thy grief I so tenderly cherished, wherefore
hast thou acted thus, leaving me in my old age to
die alone?'</p>

<p>So sharp was the sting of that dream upon
his conscience that, sighing, the Prince woke;
and his wife hearing him made inquiry as to his
grief. 'Alas!' answered Camaralzaman, 'in
my happiness with thee I had forgotten my
father.' And thereupon he recounted his dream.
So the next day the Princess Badoura went to
her father, and having told him all, besought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>leave for Camaralzaman to return for a while to
his own land so that he might comfort his father
in his old age.</p>

<p>The King readily granted his daughter's
request. Then said Badoura, 'If my husband
goes I must go too.' 'Why so?' inquired her
father. 'Because,' said she, 'if you separate us
there is no power in the world that shall keep
me alive.'</p>

<p>Now the King had learned during the years
of his daughter's captivity, that anything which
she said she meant. Therefore with much grief
and reluctance at being so compelled, he granted
her request; and having accorded them permission
to be absent for a whole year, he made
preparation for their departure. In order that
they might appear at the court of Shahzaman in
the splendour that became their rank, he presented
them with many changes of costly apparel, and
having provided a large train of horses, dromedaries,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>and attendants, he bade them an affectionate
farewell, and with many tears watched them
depart.</p>

<p>For a whole month Camaralzaman and his bride
travelled in comfort and luxury by the route that
they had chosen, and greatly was the Prince's
heart rejoiced by the thought of seeing his
father once more and presenting to his eyes the
lovely and innocent cause of all their past affliction.
Therefore, early and late they journeyed
on, only stopping to rest at night and during
the heat of each day.</p>

<p>And so it chanced that one day, about noon,
they came to a spacious meadow shaded by trees,
and there at the Prince's command the tents were
pitched; and the Princess went into her pavilion
and lay down to sleep.</p>

<p>Now when she lay down, the heat being very
great, she took off her outer robe and her girdle.
And the Prince, coming in later, saw the girdle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>lying, and knotted within its folds a large stone,
red as blood, inscribed with strange characters
which, in the darkness of the tent, he could not
read. Being curious, therefore, to see what
words were upon this talisman which the Princess
carried so secretly in her apparel, he unfastened
the knot, and taking the knot went forth
from the tent to examine it.</p>

<p>Scarcely had he done so when, with a strange
cry, a bird swooped down from the tree above his
head, caught up the stone in its beak, and flew
away with it. Camaralzaman, fearing to lose
what, for all he knew, might be a precious
talisman, ran after the bird, throwing up his arms,
shouting and endeavouring in all possible ways
to make it let go the stone. But the bird flew
on from tree to tree, and from valley to valley,
never so fast that Camaralzaman could not keep
pace with it, but never coming within his reach,
or letting go of the talisman. So the flight went
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>on and so the chase continued, till several hours
had passed and it began to grow dark. Then the
bird, uttering once more its strange cry, went
up to the topmost branch of a high tree and
settled itself to roost.</p>

<p>The pursuit had now led Camaralzaman so
far and in so many directions, that he no longer
knew which way to turn. So, commending himself
to Allah, he lay down at the foot of the tree
and slept.</p>

<p>In the morning, with a loud rustling of
feathers, the bird awakened him, and still carrying
the stone in its beak, sprang out of the tree and
continued its flight. And as Camaralzaman rose
and followed, it presently became apparent that
at whatever rate he went, the bird went too;
so when he ran the bird flew fast, and when he
could run no more it waited for him, flying from
point to point and never disappearing from view.</p>

<p>'By Allah!' cried Camaralzaman, 'this is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>wonderful! This chase will lead me either to
great fortune or to death.' So without giving
up he went on; and thus he followed the bird
for ten days, living upon roots and drinking of
the streams that he crossed; and every night he
slept at the foot of some tree while the bird
perched in its topmost branches.</p>

<p>Thus on the tenth day he was brought to the
outskirts of a large city. Then, like a flash, the
bird flew over it and disappeared; and Camaralzaman
following, footsore and weary, came to the
city gates and passed through. Here for some
time he wandered, solitary and without hope,
not knowing what to do nor of whom to seek
aid; and coming presently to the other side of
the city, he found there a harbour with much
shipping and merchandise, and people plying
their trade and talking in many languages. And
as he walked along the shore, still uncertain what
course to pursue, he came upon an old man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>working in a garden of flowers; and when he
halted the old man looked up.</p>

<p>The gardener, seeing a stranger at his gate,
came forward, and saluting him in the name of
Allah, bade him come in. 'I see by your dress,'
said he, 'that you are a Mussulman, as I also
am; and great is your good fortune to have
escaped until now the wrath of the inhabitants,
for they are unbelievers and idolaters, and fierce
is their hatred for those who are of the true faith.
Therefore come quickly into my house, and
disguise yourself; else is your life not safe.'</p>

<p>Camaralzaman was thankful to have found a
friend in such a moment of need; and after his
host had supplied him with food and drink and
made him rest for a while, then without concealment
he confided to him the whole of his story.
Greater than ever had now become his longing
to reach the island of Khaledan, for there not
only did he hope to find his father still alive,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>but to be re-united with his wife, the Princess
Badoura. Inquiring therefore of the old gardener,
he learned that there were two routes; the longer
being for the greater part of the way by land&mdash;a
year's journey, and the shorter by sea. 'But
if,' said the gardener, 'you would go by sea,
then you must wait for the merchant ship which
sails every year to the Island of Ebony, for
through that country lies your way. Had you
but come a few days earlier, you would have been
in time; but now the ship has left the harbour
and will not return for another year. If you
decide upon this course, then while you wait
my house is open to you, and if you are willing
to share my work and be my assistant, you shall
also have a fair share of the profits.'</p>

<p>Camaralzaman gladly accepted the proposition,
for better by far is work, however hard or humble
it may be, than the idleness of unavailing regret.
So for a whole year he lived with the old gardener
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>as if he had been his son, wearing a blue smock
down to his knees, working with a hoe, tending
plants, tilling the soil, and carrying its produce
for sale to the market. And every day he looked
out over the sea for the merchant vessel which
was to arrive and bear him back to his own
country and to the arms of his beloved.</p>

<p class="p2">Now turn we to the Princess Badoura, whom
we left lying asleep in her tent. When she awoke
she inquired after her husband, the Prince, but he
was not to be found; some had seen him go into
the tent, but no one had seen him come out. Then,
as she put on her dress, she noticed that the knot
in her girdle had been untied and that the stone
was missing. 'Alas, O Beloved, what hast thou
done?' she cried. 'Ignorant of its virtues thou
hast taken from me the talisman which unites us;
now surely if thou hast lost it we shall be separated
for ever.' And as time went on her distress
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>and her certainty of misfortune became greater;
for she knew that had not the Prince already lost
the talisman its infallible virtues would by now
have brought him back to her. Knowing therefore
that if the talisman were indeed lost, he also
was lost to her, and that when found, he would
return to her again, she made no useless delay in
proceeding to her destination. Yet was there now
great peril if the absence of the Prince were discovered,
lest she and her women and all the wealth
which her father had bestowed on her might fall
a prey to the men who formed their escort. For
this reason she concealed the matter from all but
her women, and having dressed herself in some of
her husband's clothes, and put into her litter a
girl-slave wearing the royal veil, she went forth
from her tent and gave orders for the camp to be
struck and their journey resumed. So, for many
days she continued to travel by land and sea, till
she came before a city set on a height with a great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>harbour lying below; and when she inquired its
name of the inhabitants they said to her, 'This is
the city of Ebony, wherein dwells King Amanos,
and he has a beautiful daughter whose name is
Hayatelnefoos.'</p>

<p>Presently word went to the palace that a
stranger prince of very noble appearance, accompanied
by a large retinue, had arrived in the
harbour and was seeking admission to the city.
Whereupon the King sent in haste certain high
dignitaries of his court to give welcome and to
conduct the supposed Prince into his presence.
And no sooner had he beheld the noble appearance
of his guest and the graciousness of her bearing
than he gave orders for a great banquet to be
prepared, appointed that she should be lodged in
the palace, and extended to her for three days an
entertainment of the most royal magnificence.</p>

<p>During the whole of these festivities the
Princess bore herself exactly as Camaralzaman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>would have done, doing honour to that rank and
name which for her own protection she had assumed.
Therefore the heart of King Amanos
was drawn greatly towards her, and when she
began to speak of departure, he said, 'Wherefore,
O Prince, shouldst thou seek to leave a country
where happiness and power can be thine? For
behold, I am an old man and childless, save for
one daughter, whose beauty and perfection resemble
thine. But, for me, the cares of state have
become too heavy a burden, and I sigh to be
released from them. Remain with us, therefore,
and I will give to thee even now the hand of
my daughter and the sceptre and rule of my
kingdom.'</p>

<p>At this proposal, so generously expressed, the
face of Badoura became covered with bashfulness,
for strange indeed to a woman was this offer of a
kingdom and a bride. Yet at her father's court
she had long since become learned in the affairs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>of state, and to rule a kingdom had ever been her
desire; moreover, since by the loss of the talisman
she and her husband seemed destined to eternal
separation, there was no cause that she could see
why her life should not thus be dedicated; there
was also some peril in a refusal, which the King
would be certain to take as an affront both to
himself and his daughter. So after pondering the
matter for a while she lifted her head and spoke
to the King as follows:</p>

<p>'O King, if I delayed for one moment my
acceptance of so splendid an offer, it was only a
knowledge of unworthiness which held me back.
Yet to delay longer might seem to throw a doubt
on the discretion of your royal mind. Beset by
these two dangers I place myself entirely in your
Majesty's hands; and if I may have your promise
of the guidance and counsel which I shall constantly
need, then I will unreservedly accept your
Majesty's proposal. To hear is to obey.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>The marriage being thus agreed on, the nuptial
ceremony was fixed for the following day. The
pretended Prince, putting a bold face upon the
matter, informed the officers of her escort of the
coming event, saying also that the Princess
Badoura had given it her approval. As for her
women, their silence was already assured since, as
partners to the deception, their very lives depended
on it.</p>

<p>So on the morrow King Amanos gathered together
his emirs, viziers, and captains, and having
presented to them the Princess Badoura as his
destined son-in-law and heir, he placed her upon
the throne and gave orders for the nuptial
ceremony to commence. And when the day
of rejoicings was ended, the Princess Badoura
was conducted to the bridal chamber.</p>

<p>But no sooner did Badoura find herself by the
side of the beautiful Princess Hayatelnefoos than
the thought of her beloved Camaralzaman overwhelmed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>her with grief, and committing herself
to prayer and recitation, she continued at her devotions
till the bride lay fast asleep. And thus she
did the next night and on the night following.</p>

<p>Finding herself thus neglected by the husband
of whom she had received such glowing reports,
the Princess Hayatelnefoos was filled with a
depression of spirit which immediately became
visible in her looks; and when her father, King
Amanos, discerning his daughter's grief, inquired
what was amiss, she informed him that her
husband, whom she already loved most tenderly,
had conceived for her an aversion so intense that
to avoid all intimacy of conversation he committed
himself to prayer, and thus continued till weariness
and sleep overcame her.</p>

<p>At this news the countenance of King
Amanos was darkened, and he said to his
daughter, 'If the Prince does not treat thee
with the respect due from a husband to a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>wife, he shall be divested of his royal dignity
and banished from my kingdom.'</p>

<p>This threat so afflicted the heart of Hayatelnefoos,
to whom the thought of separation from
her husband was already unbearable, that on
their next meeting she confided to Badoura her
grief, informing her also of the King's words
and of the danger that threatened her.</p>

<p>Then said Badoura, 'O amiable and charming
Princess, though thou canst not be my wife thou
canst be my friend. Hear first my story, and
then, if thou art unable to pardon me thou canst
at least have the satisfaction of depriving me of
life.' And forthwith she proceeded to give the
full story of her adventures.</p>

<p>When she had finished, Hayatelnefoos replied,
'O Princess, I should indeed be unworthy of
your confidence, if such a tale of misfortune had
failed to win not only my pity, but my devotion.
Henceforth we two are of one mind, and will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>have between us but one heart and one desire
for the preservation of thy life and honour
and the restoration of thy husband.'</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a href="images/large/pl08.jpg"><img src="images/pl08.jpg" alt="Badoura Watching the Ship" /></a></div>

<hr class="r35" />

<p>Thereupon the two Princesses embraced with
the tenderest affection, and from that day on,
concealing from all others the true facts, they
lived together in the greatest amity and concord;
while the Princess Badoura continued
in her husband's name to rule over the city
of Ebony, giving law and justice to all.</p>

<p class="p2">Prince Camaralzaman, meanwhile, was living
with the old gardener, tilling the soil, and carrying
each day fruit and vegetables to the market.
The time was now near for the merchant vessel
which he was awaiting to return; but having
lost the talisman of which he had come in quest,
he had little hope of a successful issue to the
adventure. So one day, when the inhabitants
of the city were making holiday and all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>markets were closed, the Prince, released from
labour, sat in deep dejection of spirit under the
trees of the garden away from the sound of
festival, when suddenly he heard a strange cry
of birds and in the leaves overhead he saw one
furiously attacking another with beak and claw.
So desperate was the fight, that before many
minutes were over one of the birds fell dead at
his feet, and the conqueror, uttering a loud cry
of triumph, flew swiftly away.</p>

<p>But hardly had it disappeared, when two
other birds of larger size came flying into the
garden, and making straight for the murdered
body they bowed their heads over it, crying
lamentably and seeking with the warmth of their
breasts to restore it to life. Presently, when all
their efforts proved vain, they scooped a grave
with their claws, and having laid therein the
slaughtered bird, they covered it with earth and
immediately soared upward and disappeared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>Camaralzaman sat weeping; for the mourning
of these birds reminded him in some way of the
grief and separation he himself had endured, and
as little could he hope for the return of his
lost happiness as they for the revival of their
dead comrade. As he was thus thinking, once
again came the strange cry he had heard before,
and looking up he saw the two birds flying back
carrying the murderer in their claws. No sooner
had they alighted above the grave than falling
upon their captive they tore out his heart and
entrails, and having drained out his blood as an
offering to the slain, they left the body lying, and
flew away.</p>

<p>All this while Camaralzaman had looked on
in wonder; and surely it seemed to him that if,
in the lower order of creation such miracles of
devotion and service were wrought, humanity had
no cause for despair. And even as he so thought,
he saw in the torn body of the bird something
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>that shone brightly, and coming nearer he recognised
it as the talisman which he had taken from
his wife's girdle.</p>

<p>Instantly all life became changed to him; seizing
the stone he wiped it of blood and pressed
it a thousand times to his lips. 'Now at last,'
he cried, 'I believe and know that my beloved
is to be restored to me!'</p>

<p>So sure was he his good fortune had now
returned to him that, unable to remain idle and
inactive, he seized a hoe, and started to break up
the ground at the foot of the tree under which
he had been standing. At the third stroke the
earth gave back a hollow and metallic sound.
Quickly removing the soil he discovered a trapdoor,
which, when it was opened, disclosed an
aperture and a narrow flight of steps. Descending
these he found himself in a deep cellar lined
with jars, twenty in all, filled with red gold.</p>

<p>Contentment now took hold of his spirit,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>and having returned to the garden he replaced
the trap and continued at his work until in the
evening the old gardener returned from the
festivities.</p>

<p>On seeing him the old man said, 'Rejoice, my
son, I bring you good tidings. The ship which
you have so long waited for is now in the harbour,
and in three days will be ready once more to
set sail.'</p>

<p>This news so delighted Camaralzaman that
taking the old man's hand he kissed it saying, 'I
too have tidings for you of a happy kind.' And
leading the gardener to the tree he lifted the trap,
and disclosed to his astonished eyes the gold that
lay stored below.</p>

<p>'Well,' said the gardener, 'I am glad that my
poor plot of ground should have yielded thee such
rich fruit. Take it, my son, and Heaven prosper
thee by its aid till thou come once more to thine
own land and the heart of thy beloved.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>'Not so,' replied Camaralzaman, 'I will take
nothing if I may not share it equally with thee.'</p>

<p>So it was agreed. Then said the gardener,
'My son, hast thou thought how to convey safely
so much gold on a voyage where thou wilt be
alone in the hands of strangers? Surely if they
find thee possessed of such wealth they will kill
thee for the sake of it. Hearken, therefore, to what
I shall advise. From this country we send olives
into all parts of the world, and many ships go
laden with them. Fill for thyself, therefore, fifty
jars from the olive-trees which are in this garden,
and at the bottom of each jar lay a portion of the
gold: so shall it be safe, and no man will know
of it.'</p>

<p>So the Prince did as the gardener advised;
and fearing lest, while on the voyage, he himself
might be robbed, he put the talisman along with
the gold in one of the olive jars, marking it with a
number so that he might know it again. Then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>he made a bargain with the owner of the vessel,
and on the third day the seamen came and carried
away the jars and stowed them on board. And
the captain said to Camaralzaman, who had accompanied
them, 'Do not be long in returning, for the
wind is fair and I only wait for you to set sail.'</p>

<p>So Camaralzaman hastened back to say farewell
to the old gardener and to thank him for all
that he had done; but when he arrived at the
house he found the old man so stricken with grief
at his departure that he was already at the point of
death. Camaralzaman therefore sat down by his
bed and tended him, holding him by the hand and
speaking many comfortable words; and toward
evening, having made his profession of faith, as all
good Mussulmans do, the old man let fell his head
and expired.</p>

<p>Camaralzaman closed his eyes, wrapped his
body for burial, and having dug a grave in the
garden, interred it. Then he went down in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>haste to the shore and found that the vessel had
gone.</p>

<p>Once again, therefore, despair returned to him,
for now a second time the talisman was lost, and
he had no hope of recovering it. Also he must
needs wait another year before the ship could
return and take him upon his way. So going to
the landlord of the garden he became a tenant in
the place of his dead friend, and hiding what remained
of the gold in fifty other olive jars, he set
to work once more as a gardener until the time
should once more come round for him to
embark.</p>

<p class="p2">Meantime, under a favourable wind, the ship
arrived at the island of Ebony; and it so happened
that as it came into the harbour the Princess
Badoura was looking out of one of the palace
windows toward the sea. No sooner did her eyes
rest upon the sails of that ship than her heart became
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>uplifted with joy. 'Surely,' she said to herself,
'either my beloved is there on board or it
brings news of him.'</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<p class="caption">Capture of Camaralzaman.<br />
'The captain of the ship goes to capture Camaralzaman at the

<div class="figcenter">
<a href="images/large/pl09.jpg"><img src="images/pl09.jpg" alt="Capture of Camaralzaman" /></a></div>

<hr class="r35" />

<p>So going down to the shore, accompanied by
her emirs and attendants, she caused the master of
the vessel to be summoned before her and inquired
of him what merchandise he had brought. 'O
King,' replied the captain, 'I have spices, drugs,
aromatic scents, and sweet ointments; I have also
rich fabrics and metal-work; and in addition to all
these things I have olives such as are not to be
found in any other country, and these, since I
came by them fortunately, I can let you have cheap.'
On hearing this a desire for the olives took
hold of the Princess, and she said, 'What quantity
have you brought?' 'Fifty jars,' answered the
master; 'that is all I have.' 'Well,' said the
Princess, 'I will take fifty.' And she paid him for
them the price that he asked&mdash;a thousand pieces
of silver.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>Now presently, when the olives had been
conveyed to the palace, there came upon the
Princess a strange desire to taste that which she
had just purchased, so she gave orders for one of
the jars to be opened and the contents to be
poured into a dish; and as the attendant poured,
first came olives and then a heap of red gold.</p>

<p>Then said Badoura to the Princess Hayatelnefoos,
who alone was with her, 'That is gold!'
So she examined further and in every jar found
gold in equal quantity. Presently as she emptied
one of the jars, along with the gold came the talisman
which Camaralzaman had concealed there;
and no sooner did the Princess Badoura see it than
she knew it again; and she showed it to Hayatelnefoos,
saying, 'Lo, this is the stone whose loss
hath caused our separation; now, finding it again,
I know that my beloved will be restored to me.'</p>

<p>Then she sent in haste and caused the master
of the vessel to be brought before her, and she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>said to him, 'Whence had you these olives?
Tell me the truth, or you shall die!'</p>

<p>Thereupon the master being smitten in his
conscience dropped to earth and lay there,
crying, 'Alas, I had them of a poor man who
brought them himself to the vessel but did not
return at the appointed time; therefore I sailed
without him. Be assured, O King, that all the
money I got for them shall be honestly paid to
him.'</p>

<p>Then said Badoura, 'As to that I care not.
But go back straightway to that country from
which you came and find the man and bring him
to me, for he is a malefactor against the laws of
this kingdom, for he hath stolen from me a
precious thing dearer than life itself; therefore is
his life forfeit. And if you fail to bring him,
then all the merchandise which you have now
brought I will hold, and no ship or merchandise
of yours shall ever enter this port again.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>But if you bring him safely, I will reward you
abundantly.'</p>

<p>The master therefore, being so compelled, left
his merchandise in bond and returned with all
haste to the port from which he had set out, and
there coming with his men to the house of
Camaralzaman, he knocked; and no sooner had
the Prince opened than, seizing him, they carried
him off, and bestowed him on board the vessel as a
prisoner.</p>

<p>Camaralzaman said to them, 'Masters, why
are you treating me thus?' They answered,
'Thou art an offender and malefactor against the
King of the Ebony Isles, son to the King
Amanos, and hast stolen his wealth; yea, a
precious thing hast thou stolen from him, and
now he requires it of thee!'</p>

<p>'Well,' said Camaralzaman, 'this is the first
that I have heard of it.'</p>

<p>So they bore him away, and after they had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>sailed for some while they came again to the city
of Ebony, and word was sent to the palace that
the master of the vessel had returned bringing
the King his prisoner.</p>

<p>Then Badoura gave orders, and Camaralzaman,
still in his workman's dress, his body wasted
with grief, and his face and hands soiled with the
defilements of his long voyage, came and stood
before her. As soon as she saw him her heart
leapt with joy, but she feared to reveal herself, for
how would it appear to her emirs and chamberlains
were she before all eyes to throw herself
into the arms of a common gardener. Therefore,
retaining her disguise, she spoke to him as a
King should do to a peasant, and in a man's
voice. And Camaralzaman, fearful of the unknown
charge which was to be brought against
him, stood before her with bowed head and
did not look up.</p>

<p>The Princess asked him but a few questions,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>of the country from which he had come, of the
time that he had lived there, and what calling
he had followed. Then she said to him, 'Be
assured that if thou art innocent of that which
is charged against thee, thine honour and integrity
shall be made known to all. Even now
if thou wilt confess to having taken a thing
which is not thine and wilt restore it to me, I
am willing to pardon thee, seeing that it was done
without thought of evil.' But Camaralzaman
hearing these words knew not what they meant,
for his thoughts were all astray and he did not
dream that it was of himself and of the talisman
that she spoke.</p>

<p>Then Badoura ordered an officer of her
household to take charge of the prisoner and
treat him with all care; and having recompensed
the master of the vessel and set free his merchandise,
she went in to Hayatelnefoos, and told her
of all that had come about. And she said to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>her, 'O bosom-friend and comforter of my
heart, be sure that what brings happiness to me
shall bring it to thee also; for no fortune shall
Heaven send me, nor any bliss, however great,
that I am not ready to share equally with thee.'
Then speaking of Camaralzaman she said, 'So
great a distance divides in men's eyes what
seems his present lot from ours, that it were
peril to be sudden in this matter lest the truth
of our story should not be believed. Therefore
we must wait till of his own natural nobleness
he shall have raised himself in the eyes of all.'
And to this plan Queen Hayatelnefoos agreed.</p>

<p>So the next day Badoura gave orders to conduct
Camaralzaman to the bath; then she caused
him to be clad in an emir's robes and brought
forth where all might see; and lo! as a willow
branch after rain or the planet of love shining at
dusk, so seemed he then to the eyes of all.</p>

<p>Then again she caused him to be brought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>before her in the Hall of Judgment and pronounced
him clear of all that had been charged against him.
'For that which was precious to me,' she said,
'has been restored; and other hands held it from
me, not thine. Therefore as thou hast been
proved true I will appoint thee to high honour.'
Then addressing the emirs and councillors who
were gathered about her she said, 'My lords, this
Camaralzaman whom to-day I admit to my Councils
is not unworthy of the high post which I confer
on him; for not only have I tested him as ye
have seen on an accusation whereof he is innocent,
but he is a man of approved valour, of grace, and
learning, being also a descendant of kings.'</p>

<p>Great was Camaralzaman's astonishment at
finding his name and lineage known to the King
of the Ebony Isles; but not daring to question
how his good fortune had come about he prostrated
himself before the throne, saying, 'O King,
only by thy favour have I been raised to this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>honour, and by that alone can I either deserve
or maintain it.' So the Council ended, and
Camaralzaman was conducted to a large and
sumptuous abode with slaves and attendants to
wait upon him, and everything that his heart
could desire save only his beloved Princess.</p>

<p>After a few days Badoura, wishing to find
occasion for Camaralzaman's more frequent presence,
appointed him to the office of Grand
Treasurer, and thereafter scarcely a day passed
that she did not bestow on him fresh honours;
while Camaralzaman, for his part, wondering why
such high favours were shown him, served the
King diligently, and was greatly respected not
only by all the emirs and officials of the Court,
but by the common people, who swore by his life,
and would have asked no better than for such an
one as he to be their ruler.</p>

<p>So time went on, and ever did the wonder of
Camaralzaman increase why he alone had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>chosen for such great honours. And because this
thing seemed to him without reason, he came at
last to fear it. Furthermore, for loss of his beloved,
restlessness and the desire for travel filled his heart,
and in no one place could he find happiness. So
one day coming to the King&mdash;that is to say to
Badoura&mdash;he spoke as follows: 'O King of the
Age, so great is the favour that thou hast shown
me, that I know well it cannot last. Suffer me
therefore to depart before I have outstayed my
welcome; so shall my gratitude be undiminished
and the nature of thy regard for me unchanged.'
When Badoura heard these words she smiled
on him and said: 'If indeed it is thy will to
depart, then must thou take and cast away once
more&mdash;yea, lose utterly&mdash;this stone whose virtue
brought thee back to me, and by which, while it
is in my possession, our lives are bound.' So
saying she reached out and put the talisman in his
hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>When Camaralzaman beheld the stone once
more his wonder was beyond words. 'O King,'
he cried, 'whence came this to thee? For herein
lies the cause of all my afflictions and separation
from one whom I loved as my own soul.'</p>

<p>'Surely,' answered Badoura, 'none can part
from that talisman without estrangement and
separation. And since now I have parted from it
to thee, our separation must infallibly begin from
this hour. Therefore the King of the Ebony
Isles thou shalt see no more.'</p>

<p>So saying she passed out of the chamber, and
Camaralzaman stood and wondered, not knowing
what to think.</p>

<p>Then Badoura went in haste to a closet, and
there she put on the dress and the girdle which
she had worn on the day of separation; and taking
from her head the man's turban, she spread her
hair and put on a head-dress of fine gold delicately
wrought. So she returned to him, and when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>Camaralzaman saw her he uttered a cry and ran
into her arms and held her with kisses as if he
could never let her go. And when at last he
spoke of things other than his joy&mdash;'How,' he
inquired, 'has the King accomplished this miracle?
Surely when he spoke I understood nothing of
what he said.'</p>

<p>Badoura smiled as she answered: 'When the
King put the talisman into thy hand, then did his
kingship cease, and he returned once more to his
true form. O my lord, look upon thy king, who
is now become thy slave. Surely hadst thou loved
me a little more thou wouldst have known me.'</p>

<p>Then she told Camaralzaman of all that had
happened to her from first to last; and on the
morrow she went to King Amanos, and to him
also made her story plain. Nor would she allow
that any deception had been used, 'For truly,' she
said, 'I and my beloved are one; and I did but
come before and prepare for him the place which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>he was destined to fill. Therefore when I married
thy daughter, it was Camaralzaman who married
her; and when I accepted of thee the crown, it was
Camaralzaman who accepted it. Give me leave,
therefore, O King, who hast been to me as a father,
to show my beloved to the Queen whom I have
won for him, and to the people over whom, in his
name, I have ruled.'</p>

<p>Greatly was King Amanos astonished to hear
a woman utter such words; and the wonder of
Camaralzaman was scarcely less. Yet, as she had
brought fortune and happiness to both alike, they
consented to do her will; and so it was agreed.</p>

<p>Therefore from that day on did Camaralzaman
take up the power and authority which Badoura
had attained for him, rejoicing also in the domestic
felicity of two wives, the one as beautiful as the
other, each without jealousy, and having no wish
or thought out of which estrangement could arise.
Doubtless it was the perfect happiness in which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>he thus dwelt which caused Camaralzaman to
forget altogether the object for which his journey
had been begun. No second dream of his father,
the King Shahzaman, ever came to remind him of
his neglected purpose, while to the dominions of
King Gaiour of China he had no wish to return.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Epilogue</h2>

<p>'This, O King, is the story of Prince Camaralzaman
and of the Princess Badoura from
the time of their falling in love until the day when
all their wanderings of separation were ended. A
year later the two Queens each presented him with
a son almost upon the same day. And the birth
of these Princes was celebrated with every kind of
festivity and rejoicing.'</p>

<p>As Scheherazade concluded her story the
light of dawn grew full. For a thousand and one
nights she had given entertainment to her lord,
saving at the same time the lives of her fellow-women.
During this period she had borne the
King three children, all with so strong a resemblance
to their father that even he could find no
cause in them for casting suspicion upon his wife's
virtue.</p>

<p>So the tale being ended Scheherazade rose, and
having kissed the ground at the King's feet, said,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>'O King of the Age, perfect and incomparable, lo
in dust and ashes I thy slave come to present to
thee a petition.' And the King said, 'Ask, and
it shall be granted thee.'</p>

<p>Then Scheherazade called to her attendants
and said, 'Bring in the children!' So they
brought the children quickly; one of them
walked, one crawled, and one lay at the breast.</p>

<p>So she set them before the King, and said,
'These children are thine and mine. In pain I
bore them, having little hope of any joy that they
might bring me; for under sentence of death I
brought them into the world, and though thrice
I have been a mother thou hast not yet pardoned
me. Say, therefore, O King, when is my death to
be; or, if it is not to be, then let my suspense be
ended.'</p>

<p>At these words the King wept; and embracing
his children tenderly, cried: 'O Scheherazade,
by Allah I swear to thee that before the coming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>of these children thou wast pardoned already.
Nor shall the death of such an one as thou be laid
to my charge when Kings come before God to be
judged.'</p>

<p>Then Scheherazade fell down and kissed his
feet and his hands, crying, 'God give thee a long
life, and power and strength, and dominion and
majesty to the world's end.'</p>

<p>Joy of that news spread through the palace,
and thence to the city and all the people; and
the night of rejoicing that followed was a night
not to be reckoned among lives, for its colour was
as the rainbow in its promise over young fields of
corn, and its light whiter than the face of day.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
